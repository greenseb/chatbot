This is my simple chat bot that I made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. I already had some knowledge of HTML and CSS, and some JavaScript/jQuery as a result of taking Angela Yu's Web Dev course on Udemy. 

I filled the gaps in my knowledge and added some flair by reading articles and watching some tutorials, but avoided explicitly copying code from them.

YouTube channels I watched before and during this assignment:

-Code Palace  
-The Net Ninja  
-FreeCodeCamp  
-Heri Kaniugu  

All other credit is given in comments on the code itself.

The Chat Bots responses are all pre-determined, but I would love to learn how to implement an AI aspect to it further down the line.

Thank-you for your time!
